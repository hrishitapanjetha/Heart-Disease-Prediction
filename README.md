# Heart Disease Prediction

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease using machine learning techniques on the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset.

## Dataset
- **File:** `Heart_disease_cleveland_new.csv`
- The dataset contains patient medical information and is commonly used for heart disease prediction tasks.

## Project Structure
- `heartdiseaseprediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `Heart_disease_cleveland_new.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open `heartdiseaseprediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run the notebook cells to:
    - Load and explore the dataset
    - Preprocess the data
    - Train machine learning models
    - Evaluate model performance

## Example
The notebook will guide you through:
- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model selection and training
- Performance evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)
